select * from categories as c where not exists(select * from products as p where p.category_id=c.category_id);

AUTO INCREMENT:
alter table products modify product_id int auto_increment;

member(varchar(20))->member ENUM

UNION OPERATION
------------
IT AUTOMATICAL ELIMINATE ITS DUPLICATE

UNIONALL
-------


q6.reterive all category name and product name?
select name from categories union select name from products;
select name from categories union all select name from products;


VIEWS
------
view is known as virtual table.
table is an physical object but view is a logical object.
it gives security purpose 
if we take a join data in multiple tables we can create view
whenever use view that will work it cannot store in any database

select * from categories join products on categories.category_id=products.category_id;(X)
select * from categories left outer join products on categories.category_id=products.category_id;

 create view product_category as(select c.category_id,c.name as category_name,c.parent_category,p.product_id,p.name as product_name,p.price,p.quantity from categories as c  left outer join products as p on c.category_id=p.category_id);

select * from product_category;

TRIGER-is a kind of function.but automatical executed(automatical call in database)
whenever a event occur it will automatical call
update,insert,delect these are all functions(events)
there is no return.it is a group of functions

events:insert,delete,update
time:before/after event occur in db ;
before insert/after insert
"   delete   /  "   delete
 "   update   / "   update

NEW AND OLD-predefined data variables

NEW-insert ((eg:NEW.rollno)  latest rollno)
OLD-delete ((eg:OLD.rollno) recover the attribute)
NEW AND OLD-update

CURSOR
-------
database object
by creating a object we have to create a buffer area
it can use inside the function and procedure
select query will give multiple records that can be store in the cursor
1) declare-declare cursor(select)
2) open-open cursor
3) fetch-fetch each records,iterate for processing
4) close-close cursor


cursor display the list of student:
1)declare <cn> cursor for 
select <attributelist> from <table name> where <cond>
2) open <cn>
3) fetch <cn> into <varible name>
4) close <cn>
